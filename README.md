# Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website showcasing my skills, projects, and experience as an AI Engineer.

## Features

- Responsive design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Showcases skills, education, and projects
- Dockerized for easy deployment
- CI/CD pipeline set up with GitHub Actions for automated testing

## Automated Code Push Script

To simplify development, I created a script that automatically stages, commits, and pushes code changes to the GitHub repository. This helps keep the repository up-to-date without manual Git commands.

### Usage

Run the script from your project directory:

```bash
./git_push.sh "Your commit message here"
